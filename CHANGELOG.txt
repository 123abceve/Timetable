Changelog:

- Redesign based on Google's 'Material Design'
- Improved sidebar for better usability and readability
- Fixed duplicate notifications
- Prevented duplicate unit imports
- Prevented class previews being shown on calendar if class is selected
- Added maximum number of units able to be imported (mostly to prevent the sidebar from becoming too crowded)
- Removed the weekend from the calendar
- Made timetabler open next to currently selected tab if triggered by class import
- Added an 'Import All' button to add all subjects on a page
- Removed the 'Launch Timetabler' button. Importing classes can trigger launching
- Updated FullCalendar to version 2.6.1
- Added unit persistence. Reloading the page will no longer clear imported subjects
- Added calendar persistence. Reloading the page will no longer clear the calendar
- Fixed event overlap and padding. Classes now accurately resize depending on how many units are in the same time slot
- Fixed calendar stretching when modifying inline element sizing (Seems to be fixed by FullCalendar update)
- Previews are now shown for specific class types, and not for entire units
- Implemented search via unit code (e.g. IFB101) or description (e.g. "engineering")
- Added a 'Remove Unit' button for any mistaken imports or timetable changes
- Moved and renamed files for consistency and readability
- Updated extension icon
- Updated HTML5shiv
- Implemented .min css and js libraries and removed full versions
- Added WebKit scrollbar styling for better spacing in sidebar class lists

Things to do:

- Colour-code by subject in the calendar view, not by class type
- Export as QUT-formatted timetable HTML or PNG (and/or on print)
- Aim to improve preview performace (e.g. lag is produced when previewing a specific class type)
- Optimise the 'remove unit' button. The event removal code is quite laggy.
- Complete code cleanup. COMMENT ALL THE THINGS!
- Continue refining the design (e.g. Replace 'x' delete buttons with glyph icons)
- Find a way to increase hour (row) height when an event has overflow on the y-axis
- Add highlight when user hovers over a class in the sidebar that is already added to the calendar
- Implement rotating 'helpful hints' under the calendar
